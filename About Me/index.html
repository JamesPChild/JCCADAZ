        <p class="paragraph">Hi! I'm Julie Child, a color consultant and interior designer. 
          I've been helping clients choose their perfect color palette for their homes, businesses, churches, and HOA's since 2015. 
          Prior to starting my own business, I worked for Sherwin-Williams as a territorial color consultant for the Southeast Phoenix metropolitan area. 
          Spring of 2020 brought many changes to the world and my position at Sherwin-Williams was eliminated, and I started my business the next day. 
          I have been to thousands of properties, helping homeowners and business owners transform their spaces with color. 
          Let me help you choose your perfect color palette!
        </p>
